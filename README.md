# Fashion MNIST CNN Model

## Overview
This repository serves to document my journey in developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to model the Fashion-MNIST dataset, a popular benchmark for image classification in deep learning. Fashion-MNIST comprises 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items across 10 categories, including T-shirts, dresses, and sandals. The objective is to build a CNN model that accurately classifies clothing items based on their images.

## Getting Started
### Pre-requisites
To run this script, intialise a new Conda or use an existing environment to install the required dependencies.

```bash
# Create and activate new environment
conda create -n fashion-mnist-env python=3.11
conda activate fashion-mnist-env
```

### Installing Requirements
```bash
# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
